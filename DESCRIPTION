Title: Detection of active subnetwork in metabolic weighted network

Depends: R (>= 3.3.1),igraph, BioNet, parallel, foreach, doParallel
Imports: BiocGenerics
Description: Detect optimized subnetwork based on node scores and edge scores where node scores are derived from P values of multiple testing on individual metabolites with some outcome; and edge scores are derived from P values of permutation tests on pairwise correlations. Also we can detect multiple optimized subnetworks with either node score or combining node scores with edge scores with prespecified number of signaling clusters in the network.
