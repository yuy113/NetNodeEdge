Description: Detect optimized subnetworks-potential function modules based on weighted sum of node scores and edge scores 
where node scores are derived from P values of multiple testing on individual nodes (metabolites) with some outcome; 
and edge scores are derived from P values of permutation tests on pairwise correlations among all possible connecting edges 
in the whole metabolic network.Also we can detect multiple optimized subnetworks with either node scores only 
or combining node scores with edge scores with prespecified number of optimized neworks-signaling clusters in the whole network.
