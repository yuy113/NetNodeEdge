\title{Generate P values by multiple permulation tests on all the possible edges
in biological network based on multiple hyposist testing on pairwise correlations}
\usage{
pval.perm.corr(dat, nsim, MatchId = NULL, do.parallel = FALSE,
  no_cores = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{n observations of p variables in (matched) case control studies
in matrix or dataframe format. The names of the variables must be specified.}

\item{nsim}{the number of permutations for observations for each variable
in the dataset-dat, nsim set to a large number such as 100000}

\item{MatchId}{a vector representing matched id for cases and controls.
If the study doesn't have matching, then set to NULL, if matched studies,
MatchId can't contain any missing values}

\item{do.parallel}{indicator variable(T-TRUE/F-FALSE) whether useing parallel computing
with default value-F,not using parallel computing}

\item{no_cores}{The number of computing units(cores) for parallel computing
with default value-NULL when do.parallel=F,must specify the number is
do.parallel=T, if PC or laptop can use the value-detectCores() - 1 or smaller}
}
\value{
a vector of p-values for Pearson's correlations
between any two variables, with corresponding edge names connecting with '_'
}
\description{
This function calculate P values in multiple testing to check associations
among any two variables(nodes) in case control studies
 (biological network) by comparing observed Pearson's correlations
with those in permutated samples through nonparametric permutation tests.
